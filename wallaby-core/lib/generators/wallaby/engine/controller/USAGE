Description:
    Generate controller for Wallaby Engine usage by given NAME.
    It also takes the PARENT name and makes the generated controller inherit from the PARENT.

    For example, if 'apples' is provided as the NAME, this generator will carry out the following items:
    - Generate ApplesController that inherits from Wallaby Engine's application controller.

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:controller admin/users

    This will create:
    - app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:controller admin/users admin/application

    This will create:
    - app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb

    And it makes Admin::UsersController class inherit from Admin::ApplicationController
