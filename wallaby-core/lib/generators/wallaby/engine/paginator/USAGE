Description:
    Generate paginator for Wallaby Engine usage by given NAME.
    It also takes the PARENT name and makes the generated paginator inherit from the PARENT.

    For example, if 'apple' is provided as the NAME, this generator will carry out the following items:
    - Generate ApplePaginator that inherits from Wallaby Engine's application paginator.

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:paginator admin/user

    This will create:
    - app/paginators/admin/user_paginator.rb

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:paginator admin/user admin/application

    This will create:
    - app/paginators/admin/user_paginator.rb

    And it makes Admin::UserPaginator class inherit from Admin::ApplicationPaginator
