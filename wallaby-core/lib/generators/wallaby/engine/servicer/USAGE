Description:
    Generate servicer for Wallaby Engine usage by given NAME.
    It also takes the PARENT name and makes the generated servicer inherit from the PARENT.

    For example, if 'apple' is provided as the NAME, this generator will carry out the following items:
    - Generate AppleServicer that inherits from Wallaby Engine's application servicer.

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:servicer admin/user

    This will create:
    - app/servicers/admin/user_servicer.rb

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:servicer admin/user admin/application

    This will create:
    - app/servicers/admin/user_servicer.rb

    And it makes Admin::UserServicer class inherit from Admin::ApplicationServicer
