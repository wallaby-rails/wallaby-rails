Description:
    Generate authorizer for Wallaby Engine usage by given NAME.
    It also takes the PARENT name and makes the generated authorizer inherit from the PARENT.

    For example, if 'apple' is provided as the NAME, this generator will carry out the following items:
    - Generate AppleAuthorizer that inherits from Wallaby Engine's application authorizer.

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:authorizer admin/user

    This will create:
    - app/authorizers/admin/user_authorizer.rb

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:authorizer admin/user admin/application

    This will create:
    - app/authorizers/admin/user_authorizer.rb

    And it makes Admin::UserAuthorizer class inherit from Admin::ApplicationAuthorizer
