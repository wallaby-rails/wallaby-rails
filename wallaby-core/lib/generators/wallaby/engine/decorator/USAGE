Description:
    Generate decorator for Wallaby Engine usage by given NAME.
    It also takes the PARENT name and makes the generated decorator inherit from the PARENT.

    For example, if 'apple' is provided as the NAME, this generator will carry out the following items:
    - Generate AppleDecorator that inherits from Wallaby Engine's application decorator.

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:decorator admin/user

    This will create:
    - app/decorators/admin/user_decorator.rb

Example:
    rails generate wallaby:engine:decorator admin/user admin/application

    This will create:
    - app/decorators/admin/user_decorator.rb

    And it makes Admin::UserDecorator class inherit from Admin::ApplicationDecorator
