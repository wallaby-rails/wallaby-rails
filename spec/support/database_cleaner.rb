  #       (or set it to false) to prevent uncommitted transactions being used in
  #       JavaScript-dependent specs.
  #       During testing, the Ruby app server that the JavaScript browser driver
  #       connects to uses a different database connection to the database connection
  #       used by the spec.

  #       This Ruby app server database connection would not be able to see data that
  #       has been setup by the spec's database connection inside an uncommitted
  #       transaction.
  #       Disabling the use_transactional_fixtures setting helps avoid uncommitted
  #       transactions in JavaScript-dependent specs, meaning that the Ruby app server
  #       database connection can see any data set up by the specs.
