# Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on Stack Overflow where the questions should be tagged with tag angular.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.
To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

If you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via our gitter channel.
