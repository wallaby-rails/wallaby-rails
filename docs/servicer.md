# Servicer

> NOTE: Servicer is NOT a service object.

Servicer contains a collection of CRUD operations that can be overridden and tailered to the needs.

First of all, it's always recommended to create a base servicer class `Admin::ApplicationServicer` as below, so that devs can have better control of developing global changes/functions:

```ruby
# app/servicers/admin/application_servicer.rb
class Admin::ApplicationServicer < Wallaby::ModelServicer
end
```

This base servicer can be generated by Wallaby generator as well (since 5.2.0):

```shell
rails g wallaby:install
```

> See [Mapping - Servicer](configuration.md#servicer) for the configuration if `Admin::ApplicationServicer` is taken for other purpose.

Starting with:

- [Declaration](#declaration)

Configuration can be set for:

- [.base_class!](#base_class) (since 5.2.0) - flagging as base class.
- [.namespace](#namespace) (since 5.2.0) - specifying the namespace so that model class can be detected.
- [.model_class](#model_class) - specifying the model class.

Accessing helper methods:

- [#user](#user) (since 5.2.0) - accessing user object.
- [#authorizer](#authorizer) (since 5.2.0) - accessing authorizer which provides functions for authorization.

Customizing CRUD operations:

- [permit](#permit) - whitelisting params for mass assignment.
- [collection](#collection) - returning records from data source.
- [paginate](#paginate) - paginating records.
- [new](#new) - initializing the new resource object for form to use.
- [find](#find) - finding the record.
- [create](#create) - creating record.
- [update](#update) - updating record.
- [destroy](#destroy) - deleting record.

## Declaration

> Read more at [Servicer Naming Convention](convention.md#servicer)

Let's see how a servicer can be created so that Wallaby knows its existence.

Similar to the way in Rails, create a custom servicer for model `Product` inheriting from `Admin::ApplicationServicer` (the base servicer mentioned [above](#servicer)) as below:

```ruby
# app/servicers/product_servicer.rb
class ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
end
```

If `ProductServicer` is taken, it is still possible to use another name (e.g. `Admin::ProductServicer`). However, the attribute `model_class` must be specified. See [`model_class`](#model_class) for examples.

## .base_class!

> since 5.2.0

All servicers will be preloaded and processed by Wallaby in order to build up the mapping between servicers and models. If the servicer is considered not to be processed, it can be flagged by using `base_class!`:

```ruby
# app/servicers/admin/special_servicer.rb
class Admin::SpecialServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
  base_class!
end
```

## .namespace

> since 5.2.0

If all servicers are going to be placed under a namespace, for example, `Admin`, then namespace can be configured:

```ruby
# app/servicers/admin/application_servicer.rb
class Admin::ApplicationServicer < Wallaby::ModelServicer
  self.namespace = 'Admin'
end
```

So that all its subclasses can detect its associated model class correctly and no [.model_class](#model_class) needs to be configured:

```ruby
class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
end

Admin::ProductServicer.model_class
# => Product
```

## .model_class

According to Wallaby's [Servicer Naming Convention](convention.md#servicer), if a custom servicer cannot reflect the association to the correct model, for example, as `Admin::ProductServicer` to `Product`, it is required to specify the model class in the servicer as below:

```ruby
# app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
  self.model_class = Product
end
```

For version below 5.2.0, it is:

```ruby
# app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
  def self.model_class
    Product
  end
end
```

# Helper Methods

## #user

> since 5.2.0

It's the reference of `current_user` from controller. To access `user`, it goes:

```ruby
# app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
  self.model_class = Product

  def send_promotion_email
    ProductMailer.with(user: user).promotion_email.deliver_later
  end
end
```

## #authorizer

> since 5.2.0

It's the instance of [Model Authorizer](authorizer.md) that does authorization for the model and the action

# CRUD

## permit

This is the template method to whitelist parameters for mass assignment automatically. It works differently for different ORMs, for example:

- ActiveRecord

  > NOTE: as described below, Wallaby doesn't automatically permit nested attribute params for `has_one` associations.

  ```ruby
  # app/models/product.rb
  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :product_detail
    has_one :picture, as: :imageable
    has_many :order_items, class_name: Order::Item.name
    has_many :orders, through: :order_items
    belongs_to :category
    has_and_belongs_to_many :tags
  end

  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product
  end

  product_servicer.permit params, 'create'
  product_servicer.permit params, 'update'
  # both will work like =>
  # params.require(:product).permit(
  #   "sku", "name", "description",
  #   "category_id",
  #   "order_item_ids"=>[], "order_ids"=>[], "tag_ids"=>[]
  # )
  ```

- HER

  > NOTE: as described below, Wallaby doesn't permit association fields as Her doesn't handle association field update.

  ```ruby
  # app/models/her/product.rb
  module Her
    class Product
      include Her::Model
      attributes :sku, :name

      has_one :picture, class_name: Her::Picture.name
      belongs_to :category, class_name: Her::Category.name
      has_many :orders, class_name: Her::Order.name
    end
  end

  # app/servicers/admin/her/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::Her::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Her::Product
  end

  product_servicer.permit params, 'create'
  product_servicer.permit params, 'update'
  # both will work like =>
  # params.require(:product).permit(
  #   "sku", "name"
  # )
  ```

Please keep in mind that when servicer permits parameters, its behavior is affected by authorizer's [permit_params](authorizer.md#permit_params) as well.

- For example, if pundit policy has defined following `permitted_attributes`:

  ```ruby
  # app/policies/product_policy.rb
  class ProductPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
    def permitted_attributes
      if user.admin? || user.owner_of?(product)
        [:sku, :name, :category_id]
      else
        [:description]
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  Then servicer will only allow what policy has allowed instead of the general fields.

To customize what params should be permitted, it goes:

- if utilizing what Wallaby has implemented:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def permit(params, action)
      permitted = super
      action == 'create' ? permitted : permitted.slice(:name)
    end
  end
  ```

- or simply replacing this template method:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def permit(params, action)
      if action == 'create'
        params.require(:product).permit(:sku, :name, product_detail_attributes: [:meta_data])
      else
        authorizer.permit_params action, model_class
      end
    end
  end
  ```

## collection

This is the template method that queries data source and returns a collection of data. It works slightly different for different ORMs:

- ActiveRecord

  It handles the following parameters:

  - `params[:q]`: an expression to perform search (see [Colon Search](search_manual.md) for more information).
  - `params[:sort]`: expression (e.g. `name asc,updated_at desc`) to perform sorting.
  - `params[:filter]`: the filter name (e.g. `red`) that Wallaby should apply its scope (e.g. `where color: red`) to the search

- HER

  It handles the following parameters:

  - `params[:q]`: an expression to perform search (see [Colon Search](search_manual.md) for more information).
  - `params[:filter]`: the filter name (e.g. `red`) that Wallaby should apply its scope (e.g. `where color: red`) to the search

  HER doesn't handle sorting and therefore Wallaby doesn't handle sorting for HER models neither.

Please keep in mind that the query that servicer carries out is also filtered by authorizer's [accessible_for](authorizer.md#accessible_for) method.

- For example, if ability has defined following condition:

  ```ruby
  # app/models/ability.rb
  class Ability
    include CanCan::Ability

    def initialize(user)
      can :index, Product, active: true
    end
  end
  ```

  Then the scope `active: ture` will be applied to query as well.

To customize how query should be carried out, it goes:

- if utilizing what Wallaby has implemented:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def collection(params)
      super.where active: true
    end
  end
  ```

- or simply replacing this template method:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def collection(params)
      if params[:active]
        Product.where active: true
      else
        authorizer.accessible_for :index, Product.where(nil)
      end
    end
  end
  ```

## paginate

This is the template method that handles pagination for a query. It works differently for different ORMs:

- ActiveRecord

  `kaminari` is used to handle pagination with the following params:

  - `params[:page]`: page number for pagination.
  - `params[:per]`: page size for pagination.

- HER

  HER doesn't handle pagination and therefore Wallaby doesn't handle and pagination for HER models either.

To customize how query should be paginated, it goes:

- if utilizing what Wallaby has implemented:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def paginate(query, params)
      super.per 100
    end
  end
  ```

- or simply replacing this template method:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def paginate(query, params)
      query.page(params[:page_number]).per(params[:page_size])
    end
  end
  ```

## new

This is the template method that builds the resource instance for creation form page. It works pretty much the same for both ActiveRecord and HER.

To customize how resource instance should be initialized, it goes:

- if utilizing what Wallaby has implemented:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def new(params)
      super.tap do |resource|
        resource.active = true
      end
    end
  end
  ```

- or simply replacing this template method:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def new(params)
      Product.new(params.merge active: true)
    end
  end
  ```

## find

This is the template method that finds the record from data source. It works pretty much the same for both ActiveRecord and HER.

To customize how resource should be found, it goes:

- if utilizing what Wallaby has implemented:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def find(id, params)
      super.tap do |resource|
        resource.active = true
      end
    end
  end
  ```

- or simply replacing this template method:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def find(id, params)
      Product.friendly.find id
    end
  end
  ```

## create

This is the template method that create the resource and save to data source. It works pretty much the same for both ActiveRecord and HER.

Please keep in mind that the attributes will be filtered by authorizer's [attributes_for](authorizer.md#attributes_for) method.

- For example, if ability has defined following condition:

  ```ruby
  # app/models/ability.rb
  class Ability
    include CanCan::Ability

    def initialize(user)
      can :index, Product, active: true
    end
  end
  ```

  Then the attribute `active: ture` will be applied to resource before saving.

To customize how resource should be created, it goes:

- if utilizing what Wallaby has implemented:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def create(resource, params)
      resource.active = true
      super
    end
  end
  ```

- or simply replacing this template method:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def create(resource, params)
      ensure_attributes_for authorizer, :create, resource
      resource.save if valid? resource
      resource
    end
  end
  ```

## update

This is the template method that update the resource and save to data source. It works pretty much the same for both ActiveRecord and HER.

Please keep in mind that the attributes will be filtered by authorizer's [attributes_for](authorizer.md#attributes_for) method.

- For example, if ability has defined following condition:

  ```ruby
  # app/models/ability.rb
  class Ability
    include CanCan::Ability

    def initialize(user)
      can :index, Product, active: true
    end
  end
  ```

  Then the attribute `active: ture` will be applied to resource before saving.

To customize how resource should be updated, it goes:

- if utilizing what Wallaby has implemented:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def update(resource, params)
      resource.active = true
      super
    end
  end
  ```

- or simply replacing this template method:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def update(resource, params)
      ensure_attributes_for authorizer, :update, resource
      resource.save if valid? resource
      resource
    end
  end
  ```

## destroy

This is the template method that destroy the resource from data source. It works pretty much the same for both ActiveRecord and HER.

To customize how resource should be destroyed, it goes:

- if utilizing what Wallaby has implemented:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def destroy(resource, params)
      super.tap do
        audit_log :destroy, resource
      end
    end
  end
  ```

- or simply replacing this template method:

  ```ruby
  # app/servicers/admin/product_servicer.rb
  class Admin::ProductServicer < Admin::ApplicationServicer
    self.model_class = Product

    def destroy(resource, params)
      unregister resource
      resource.destroy
    end
  end
  ```
